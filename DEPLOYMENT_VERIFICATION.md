# 🔍 Deployment Verification Guide

## ✅ What Was Just Done

1. **Empty commit pushed** to trigger GitHub Pages deployment
2. **Commit ID:** `28f2218` - "Trigger GitHub Pages deployment"
3. **Automatic deployment** should now be running

---

## 📊 How to Verify Deployment

### Step 1: Check GitHub Actions
Visit: **https://github.com/ralph-data4good/zw-calculator/actions**

You should see:
- ✅ New workflow run starting/running
- 🟡 "pages build and deployment" in progress (yellow dot)
- ⏱️ Takes 2-3 minutes to complete
- ✅ Will show green checkmark when done

### Step 2: Wait for Completion
**Expected:** One "pages build and deployment" workflow

**Status indicators:**
- 🟡 Yellow dot = In progress
- ✅ Green checkmark = Success
- ❌ Red X = Failed (tell me if this happens)

### Step 3: Test Your Site
Once you see the green checkmark, visit:

**🌐 https://ralph-data4good.github.io/zw-calculator/**

**Expected to see:**
1. Welcome screen with Zero Waste Asia title
2. "Get Started" button
3. Three feature cards
4. Scenario mapping section

## 🎯 If Actions Tab Shows Nothing New

This might happen if GitHub isn't configured for automatic deployment. Here's how to fix it:

### Enable GitHub Pages (Manual Check):

1. **Go to your repository:**
   https://github.com/ralph-data4good/zw-calculator

2. **Click Settings** (⚙️ icon at top)

3. **Click "Pages"** in left sidebar

4. **Check "Build and deployment" section:**
   - **Source:** Should be "GitHub Actions" or "Deploy from a branch"
   
   **If it says "GitHub Actions":** ✅ You're good, just wait
   
   **If it says "Deploy from a branch":**
   - Under **Branch:** Select `main`
   - Under **Folder:** Select `/ (root)`
   - Click **Save**
   - Wait 2-3 minutes

5. **Refresh the Actions tab** to see the deployment

## 🔧 Alternative: Manual Trigger

If automatic deployment isn't working, you can trigger it manually:

### Option A: Through GitHub UI
1. Go to: https://github.com/ralph-data4good/zw-calculator/actions
2. If you see a workflow, click "Re-run jobs"
3. Wait for completion

### Option B: Through Code (I can do this)
Just let me know and I'll push another change to trigger it.
