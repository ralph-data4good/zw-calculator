# üîç Quick Deployment Verification

## ‚úÖ What Just Happened

I've triggered a **fresh GitHub Pages deployment** by pushing a commit. Here's how to verify it's working:

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Verification

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Check GitHub Actions (Required)
1. Go to: https://github.com/ralph-data4good/zw-calculator/actions
2. You should now see a **NEW** workflow run called **"pages build and deployment"**
3. Wait for it to complete (usually 30-60 seconds)
4. It should show a ‚úÖ **green checkmark** when done

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Visit Your Live Site (Required)
Once the deployment completes, visit:
**https://ralph-data4good.github.io/zw-calculator/**

You should see:
- ‚úÖ A welcome screen with "Zero Waste Asia Calculator" 
- ‚úÖ Feature cards explaining what the calculator does
- ‚úÖ "How It Works" section
- ‚úÖ A "Get Started" button to begin the calculator flow
- ‚úÖ NO blank white screen
- ‚úÖ NO 404 error

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Calculator (Recommended)
1. Click **"Get Started"** on the welcome screen
2. The URL should change to `.../?step=step1`
3. You should see **"Step 1: Baseline Data"** with input fields
4. Try filling in some values and clicking **"Next Step"**
5. Navigate through all 6 steps (Step 0-5)

## üö® If You Still See Issues

### Problem: Actions Tab Shows No New Deployment
**Solution:** Refresh the page. GitHub sometimes caches the Actions view.

### Problem: Site Still Shows Blank Screen
**Possible Causes:**
1. **Browser Cache:** Hard refresh with `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. **Deployment Still Running:** Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub Pages to update
3. **Wrong URL:** Make sure you're visiting `https://ralph-data4good.github.io/zw-calculator/` (with the trailing slash)

### Problem: 404 Error
**Solution:** 
1. Check GitHub Pages settings: https://github.com/ralph-data4good/zw-calculator/settings/pages
2. Ensure "Source" is set to **"Deploy from a branch"**
3. Ensure "Branch" is set to **"main"** and folder is **"/ (root)"**

## üéâ What's Different Now

The issue was that **automatic GitHub Pages deployment wasn't triggering** for documentation-only commits. By modifying the `.nojekyll` file, I've forced GitHub to detect a change and trigger a fresh deployment.

Your site has been properly built with:
- ‚úÖ All 5 preset scenarios
- ‚úÖ Full 6-step calculator flow
- ‚úÖ Interactive charts and visualizations
- ‚úÖ Edit drawer for modifying inputs
- ‚úÖ Snapshot export functionality
- ‚úÖ Responsive design with ZWA branding

**Next Step:** Wait 1-2 minutes, then visit the links above to verify! üöÄ
