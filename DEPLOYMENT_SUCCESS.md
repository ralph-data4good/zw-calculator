# üéâ Deployment Successfully Triggered!

## What Was Done

I've successfully created a **fresh deployment** to GitHub Pages. Here's what was fixed and deployed:

### Issues Resolved

1. **Fixed index.html Build Issue**
   - The source `index.html` had old built asset references that were breaking the build process
   - Restored it to the proper source format (referencing `/src/main.tsx`)
   - Build process now generates proper production files

2. **Fresh Build Created**
   - Ran `npx tsc && npx vite build` successfully
   - Generated new optimized production assets:
     - `assets/index-si3oHWp-.js` (698 KB, gzipped to 204 KB)
     - `assets/index-D9WSEMUa.css` (18.6 KB, gzipped to 4.28 KB)
     - `dist/index.html` (transformed with correct asset references)

3. **Deployment Files Ready**
   - Copied all built files from `dist/` to repository root
   - Added `.nojekyll` file to prevent Jekyll processing
   - All files committed and pushed to GitHub

4. **New Deployment Triggered**
   - Commit: `38bfe0c` - "Trigger new GitHub Pages deployment - fresh build verified"
   - Pushed to `main` branch
   - GitHub Pages automatic deployment should be running now

## How to Verify Deployment

### Step 1: Check GitHub Actions

1. Go to: https://github.com/ralph-data4good/zw-calculator/actions
2. Look for **"pages build and deployment"** workflow
3. The most recent run should be **in progress** or show a **green checkmark** ‚úÖ
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment to complete

### Step 2: Visit Your Site

Once the deployment shows green ‚úÖ:

üåê **Your Calculator**: https://ralph-data4good.github.io/zw-calculator/

### Step 3: Test the Calculator

The deployed calculator should now show:

‚úÖ **Step 0: Welcome & Instructions**
- Introduction to the Zero Waste Asia Calculator
- Feature cards explaining the tool
- "How It Works" section
- Optional Scenario Mapper

‚úÖ **Step 1: Basic Inputs**
- Population input
- Waste per capita
- Characterization (Organics, Recyclables, Residuals, Special)
- 5 preset scenarios (Rural, Urban, Mountain, Island, Custom)

‚úÖ **Step 2: Calculations**
- Total daily waste (kg)
- Annual waste (tons)
- Waste composition breakdown

‚úÖ **Step 3: Charts**
- Waste composition pie chart
- Cost comparison bars
- Savings visualization

‚úÖ **Step 4: Detailed Breakdown**
- Math walkthrough with equations
- Transparent calculations

‚úÖ **Step 5: Export**
- Download snapshot as JSON

## Why the Previous Deployments Failed

### The Root Cause
The GitHub Actions tab showed failed deployments because:

1. **Custom Workflow Conflict**: The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` we created was conflicting with GitHub's automatic Pages deployment
2. **Solution**: We deleted the custom workflow and let GitHub handle it automatically

### Why It Shows "Deploy to GitHub Pages" Workflow
GitHub Pages now uses **automatic deployment** via Actions when you:
- Have a repository with GitHub Pages enabled
- Push to the `main` branch (or configured branch)
- Have built files in the repository root

The workflow is automatically created by GitHub - you don't need to maintain it.

## Current Deployment Status

### What's Deployed
```
Repository Root:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html           (Built version with asset references)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index-si3oHWp-.js    (Main JS bundle)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index-D9WSEMUa.css   (Styles)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .nojekyll            (Prevents Jekyll processing)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ favicon.svg          (Site icon)
```

### GitHub Pages Settings
- **Source**: Deploy from a branch (main)
- **Branch**: main / (root)
- **Live URL**: https://ralph-data4good.github.io/zw-calculator/

---

## Expected Timeline

‚è±Ô∏è **Deployment typically takes 1-2 minutes**

- Push to GitHub: ‚úÖ **DONE**
- GitHub Actions trigger: ‚è≥ **Should start immediately**
- Build & Deploy: ‚è≥ **1-2 minutes**
- Site live: ‚è≥ **After Actions completes**

---

## If You Still See Issues

### 1. Hard Refresh Your Browser
After deployment completes:
- **Windows**: `Ctrl + F5`
- **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + R`
- This clears cached versions

### 2. Check Actions Tab
- If the workflow is still running, wait for it to complete
- If it failed (red X), check the error logs

### 3. Verify Pages Settings
1. Go to: https://github.com/ralph-data4good/zw-calculator/settings/pages
2. Confirm:
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: "main" / "(root)"
   - Status shows: "Your site is live at..."

### 4. Clear GitHub Pages Cache
If the site still shows old content after 5 minutes:
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Pages
2. Click "Unpublish site"
3. Wait 30 seconds
4. Re-enable GitHub Pages (main branch, root)
5. Wait 2 minutes for fresh deployment

## Development vs Production

### Local Development (Port 5200)
- Uses **source files** from `src/`
- `index.html` references `/src/main.tsx`
- Hot reload enabled
- **To start**: `npm run dev`

### Production Build
- Creates optimized files in `dist/`
- Bundles and minifies all code
- Generates hashed filenames for caching
- **To build**: `npm run build`

### GitHub Pages Deployment
- Serves **built files** from repository root
- `index.html` references `/zw-calculator/assets/index-[hash].js`
- No build process on GitHub (serves static files)
