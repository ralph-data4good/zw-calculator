# 🎯 Enhanced Scenario Mapping Logic

## ✅ Update Complete!

The **Scenario Mapper** now properly considers **all dominant economic activities** when suggesting scenarios.

---

## 🔄 What Changed

### Before
- Only checked for "Agriculture" in dominant activities
- Ignored Commercial, Tourism, Residential, and Mixed activities
- Less intelligent suggestions

### After
- ✅ **All economic activities** now influence scenario selection
- ✅ **Priority-based logic** for more accurate suggestions
- ✅ **Context-aware** recommendations based on activity combinations

---

## 🏆 Enhanced Priority Logic

The scenario mapper now follows this priority order:

### Priority 1: Island/Coastal Areas
**Trigger**: `isCoastalIsland === 'Yes'`  
**Suggested**: Island LGU — Organics + Recycling  
**Rationale**: High transportation costs, unique logistical challenges

### Priority 2: Mountain/Agriculture
**Trigger**: `terrain === 'Mountainous'` OR `dominantActivities includes 'Agriculture'`  
**Suggested**: Mountain LGU — Organics Focus  
**Rationale**: High organics from agriculture, remote location, composting priority

### Priority 3: Tourism ⭐ NEW!
**Trigger**: `dominantActivities includes 'Tourism'`  
**Suggested**: Island LGU — Organics + Recycling  
**Rationale**: Tourism areas generate high packaging waste similar to island communities, benefit from strong recycling programs

### Priority 4: Commercial/Mixed Urban ⭐ NEW!
**Trigger**: `dominantActivities includes 'Commercial'` OR `(Urban + Mixed)`  
**Suggested**: Urban LGU — Organics + Recycling  
**Rationale**: Commercial areas have high recyclables potential (packaging, cardboard, paper)

### Priority 5: Residential/Rural ⭐ NEW!
**Trigger**: `dominantActivities includes 'Residential'` OR `Rural` OR `<25k population`  
**Suggested**: Rural LGU — Organics Focus  
**Rationale**: Residential-heavy areas generate more food waste, composting is primary strategy

### Priority 6: Urban Areas
**Trigger**: `areaType === 'Urban'` OR `population >500k`  
**Suggested**: Urban LGU — Organics + Recycling  
**Rationale**: Large population density requires comprehensive waste management

### Priority 7: Peri-urban Areas ⭐ ENHANCED!
**Trigger**: `areaType === 'Peri-urban'`  
**Suggested**: 
- Small to medium (25-100k) → Rural Organics
- Large (100k+) → Urban Organics + Recycling  
**Rationale**: Peri-urban characteristics vary by size

## 🎯 How Economic Activities Affect Suggestions

### 🏢 **Commercial**
- **Waste Profile**: High recyclables (cardboard, paper, plastics)
- **Suggested Scenario**: Urban Organics + Recycling
- **Key Features**: 
  - Organics: 52%
  - Recyclables: 26%
  - Higher recycling adoption (65%)

**Example Use Case**: 
- City center with shops and offices

  - Organics: 55%
  - Recyclables: 28%
  - High recycling focus (70%)

**Example Use Case**:
- Beach resorts
- Tourist destinations
- Hotel districts
- Popular attractions

**Why Island scenario?** Tourism areas face similar challenges to islands:
- High seasonal variation
- Need for visible cleanliness
- Packaging-intensive consumption
- Space constraints

---

### 🏡 **Residential** (NEW!)
- **Waste Profile**: High food waste, moderate recyclables
- **Suggested Scenario**: Rural Organics Focus
- **Key Features**:
  - Organics: 65%
  - Focus on composting (30% adoption)
  - High efficiency (75%)

**Example Use Case**:
- Suburban neighborhoods
- Residential subdivisions
- Housing communities
- Dormitory areas

---

### 🌾 **Agriculture**
- **Waste Profile**: Very high organics (70%+)
- **Suggested Scenario**: Mountain Organics Focus
- **Key Features**:
  - Organics: 68%
  - Strong composting focus
  - Agricultural integration

**Example Use Case**:
- Farming communities
- Agricultural municipalities
- Rural areas with crop production
- Livestock regions

---

### 🏙️ **Mixed** (ENHANCED!)
- **Context-Dependent**: Combines with area type
- **Urban + Mixed**: Urban Organics + Recycling
- **Rural + Mixed**: Rural Organics Focus
- **Suggested Scenario**: Varies by context

**Example Use Case**:
- Towns with diverse activities
- Areas with both residential and commercial
- Transitioning communities

---

### ❓ **Unsure** (ENHANCED!)
- **Suggested Scenario**: Default/Custom
- **Allows**: Full customization
- **Best for**: Unique or unclear situations

## 📊 Scenario Comparison

| Activity Type | Organics % | Recyclables % | Primary Strategy | Suggested Scenario |
|---------------|------------|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Agriculture** | 68% | 12% | Composting | Mountain Organics |
| **Residential** | 65% | 18% | Composting | Rural Organics |
| **Tourism** | 55% | 28% | Recycling + Organics | Island O+R |
| **Commercial** | 52% | 26% | Recycling + Organics | Urban O+R |
| **Mixed Urban** | 52% | 26% | Balanced | Urban O+R |
| **Mixed Rural** | 65% | 18% | Composting | Rural Organics |

## 🧪 Testing the Enhanced Logic

### Test Case 1: Tourism Town
**Inputs**:
- Country: Philippines
- Area Type: Urban
- **Dominant Activities**: Tourism
- Terrain: Flatland
- Coastal: No
- Population: 25-100k

**Expected Result**: Island LGU — Organics + Recycling  
**Rationale**: Tourism drives the suggestion despite not being coastal

---

### Test Case 2: Commercial District
**Inputs**:
- Country: Philippines
- Area Type: Urban
- **Dominant Activities**: Commercial
- Terrain: Flatland
- Coastal: No
- Population: 100-500k

**Expected Result**: Urban LGU — Organics + Recycling  
**Rationale**: Commercial activity indicates high recyclables

---

### Test Case 3: Residential Suburb
**Inputs**:
- Country: Philippines
- Area Type: Peri-urban
- **Dominant Activities**: Residential
- Terrain: Flatland
- Coastal: No
- Population: 25-100k

**Expected Result**: Rural LGU — Organics Focus  
**Rationale**: Residential activity prioritizes organics management

---

### Test Case 4: Agricultural Area
**Inputs**:
- Country: Philippines
- Area Type: Rural
- **Dominant Activities**: Agriculture
- Terrain: Flatland
- Coastal: No
- Population: <25k

**Expected Result**: Mountain LGU — Organics Focus  
**Rationale**: Agriculture triggers high-organics scenario

---

### Test Case 5: Mixed Urban-Commercial
**Inputs**:
- Country: Philippines
- Area Type: Urban
- **Dominant Activities**: Commercial, Residential (2 selected)
- Terrain: Flatland
- Coastal: No

## 🎨 User Experience

### Step 0: Scenario Mapper
1. User fills out the form including **dominant activities**
2. Clicks "Get Suggestion"
3. System evaluates all inputs using priority logic
4. Suggests the best-fit scenario with **rationale**
5. User can:
   - Accept suggestion → Pre-populated inputs
   - Choose different scenario
   - Skip to manual entry

### What Users See

## 💻 Implementation Details

### Code Location
`src/data/scenarios.ts` - `suggestScenario()` function

### Logic Flow
```typescript
function suggestScenario(mapping: ScenarioMappingInputs): Scenario {
  // Check priorities in order:
  1. If coastal/island → Island scenario
  2. If mountain/agriculture → Mountain scenario
  3. If tourism → Island scenario
  4. If commercial/mixed-urban → Urban scenario
  5. If residential/rural/small → Rural scenario
  6. If urban/large → Urban scenario
  7. If peri-urban → Size-based decision
  8. Default → Custom scenario
}
```

### TypeScript Safety
- ✅ Fully typed inputs
- ✅ Type-safe array checks
- ✅ Exhaustive scenario matching
